# HOV-Lane-Utilization-WSDOT

This table looks at the lane utilization for HOV lanes using data from WSDOT

Thanks to WSDOT for their excellent, Traffic Count Database System (TCDS). The link to the tool to find specific counts can be found here. https://wsdot.public.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Wsdot&mod=TCDS

In this example we are looking at the month of May, 2025, SR 520 Bridge Eastbound at Evergreen Point, location ID (D10). 

Summary

TOTAL Vehicles: 1,026,476
TOTAL Vehicles in Right Lane (Lane 1): 454,032
TOTAL Vehicles in Middle Lane (Lane 2): 484,582
TOTAL Vehicles in Left Lane (HOV) (Lane 3&4): 87,862

*Note Lane 4 is really just the bus stop, so that count is essentially just the buses. 

Percent HOV: 8.56%
Percent Non-HOV: 91.46%

Conclusion: The HOV lane in this instance is heavily underutilized. Almost 92% of vehicles are single occupancy vehicles. This leads to innefficiency in the flow of traffic and causes unneccessary congestion. A third of the lanes are rarely used, as only 1 in 10 cars are using the left lane, and 9 out of 10 cars are forced into the middle or right lane.
