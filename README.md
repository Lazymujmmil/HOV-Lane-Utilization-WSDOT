Welcome to the HOV-Lane-Utilization-WSDOT project. This repository hosts data-driven analysis of HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lane utilization on the SR 520 bridge. The data feed and source are connected to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) data portal. The data, sourced from https://wsdot.public.ms2soft.com/tcds/ serves as the foundation for the analyses, plots, and insights here. This README guides you through the project, its data, its methods, and how to reproduce results.

Overview
- This project studies how efficiently HOV lanes on the SR 520 bridge are used. It looks at vehicle occupancy, lane flows, and time-of-day patterns. It also examines how carpools and transit vehicles affect lane performance.
- The goal is to provide transportation planners and researchers with clear, actionable insights. It helps compare actual usage to policy targets and to previous periods. It supports planning decisions and performance reporting.

Project at a glance
The project focuses on HOV lane utilization on the SR 520 bridge. It uses time-stamped lane counts, vehicle occupancy estimates, and travel-time data. It aggregates data by time window, lane, and day type (weekday vs weekend). It then performs exploratory data analysis, simple statistical tests, and visualizations to summarize trends and anomalies.

This work does not claim to replace official WSDOT reports. It complements them by offering accessible, publishable visuals and reproducible analysis pipelines. It emphasizes clarity, traceability, and openness so researchers can inspect methods and reproduce results.

Data sources and licensing

- Primary data source: HOV lane usage and related traffic data via the WSDOT data portal. The data comes from the SR 520 corridor and supports the study of lane occupancy, speeds, and volumes. Data access is managed by the WSDOT platform, which provides time series, lane designations, and occupancy estimates.
- Data licensing and reuse: The data from the source is used here for analysis and visualization. If you plan to reuse the data beyond this project, review the licensing terms on the source portal and respect any usage restrictions.
- External references: The data portal is hosted by WSDOT and is accessed through the public MS2Soft site. The DS (data source) page collects traffic metrics and lane information for the SR 520 bridge.

How to run this project

Prerequisites
- A modern Python environment. This project uses Python 3.x.
- Common data libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, geopandas (optional for map visuals).
- A workspace with enough disk space to hold large traffic datasets and plots.
- Git for cloning or updating the repository.

Install and set up
- Create a dedicated virtual environment.
- Install dependencies from the requirements file if present, or install the listed libraries manually.
- Ensure you have access to the data portal or the prepackaged assets from the releases page.
- Configure any environment variables needed for data paths, API keys, or ports for dashboards.

Reproducing results
- The core results come from a pipeline that fetches data, cleans it, computes metrics, and produces visuals.
- Reproducing results requires the same data sources and a consistent environment.
- If you use the releases assets, follow the included setup steps to initialize the environment and run the analysis.

Data processing pipeline

Overview
- The processing pipeline ingests time-stamped traffic data for SR 520, filters it for HOV lane data, and aggregates by hour and lane.
- It computes occupancy metrics, lane utilization rates, and trip times for different time windows.
- The pipeline also handles missing data, outliers, and normalization across days.

Ingestion
- If you use the data directly from the WSDOT portal, you need to fetch the data through the portal‚Äôs API or data export interface.
- The code parses CSV or JSON formats and converts them into a uniform internal structure.

Cleaning
- Steps include handling missing values, filtering implausible values, and normalizing lane labels.
- Occupancy estimates are validated against reasonable bounds.
- Temporal alignment ensures data from different sources line up by timestamp.

Transformation
- Data is resampled to regular time intervals (e.g., 5-minute or 15-minute windows).
- Features include lane_id, time_of_day, day_of_week, occupancy, flow, speed, and travel_time.
- Derived metrics such as utilization rate are computed from raw counts and occupancy.

Validation
- Checks compare summary statistics to expected ranges.
- Visual checks are used to spot anomalies in time series.

Visualization and dashboards

Overview
- The project ships with visualizations that help stakeholders understand HOV lane usage.
- Visuals include line charts, heatmaps, and interactive dashboards.

Time-of-day utilization
- Plots show typical occupancy and utilization by hour.
- Weekday patterns reveal peak periods for HOV lanes.

Lane-level details
- Visuals compare utilization across lanes on the SR 520 bridge.
- This helps identify under- or over-utilized segments.

Travel-time insights
- Travel time metrics are plotted to illustrate reliability.
- Variability and delays are highlighted.

Dashboards
- Interactive dashboards summarize key metrics.
- They allow filtering by date range, lane, and day type.
- The dashboards are designed to be accessible to planners and researchers.

Maps and geographic visuals
- If map visuals are included, they show SR 520 as a corridor with lane segments.
- Geographic context helps interpret congestion patterns.

Reproducibility and validation

Code quality
- The codebase emphasizes readability and maintainability.
- Functions have clear names and short responsibilities.
- Tests cover core data transformations and visualization logic.

Data provenance
- Each dataset is linked to its source and timestamp.
- The provenance chain is preserved to ensure traceability.

Validation practices
- Visual checks validate that charts reflect known patterns.
- Statistical checks confirm that computed metrics are within expected ranges.

Environment and dependencies
- Documented versions for Python and libraries.
- Recommendations for reproducible environments, such as conda or virtualenv.

Data quality and limitations

Data quality considerations
- Data completeness can vary by day, lane, or time window.
- Occupancy estimates may have measurement uncertainty.
- External factors, like incidents or weather, can affect data quality.

Limitations
- The analysis is descriptive and exploratory.
- It does not infer causality or establish formal policy effects.
- Results may not generalize beyond SR 520 or Washington State.

Handling uncertainty
- The project notes where data gaps exist.
- It highlights when results should be interpreted with caution.
- Users can overlay uncertainty estimates on charts if available.
